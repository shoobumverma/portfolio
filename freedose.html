        <p class="paraContent">
          One of the goals was to ensure participants don't get locked out of
          their account due to forgotten credentials or a difficult login
          process. Abstract details like a login password would prove to be
          difficult to retain when forgotten. A common solution of a forgot
          password process would be adding far too much friction.
        </p>

        <p class="paraContent">
          The decision to use <span class="fw-600">phone number</span> as the
          primary login ID came naturally since many of our targeted users would
          not have access to an email address. Also, the integration of an email
          service would rely on a third party email client which would add to
          the complication of the system.
        </p>

        <p class="paraContent">
          To avoid forgotten passwords, I decided to use a
          <span class="fw-600">derivable password</span>, a password one could
          work out. Since we weren't hosting sensitive personal information in
          the account, the login measure didn't need to be very secure. After
          going through the data being collected as part of the registration
          process, the PIN Code stood out to have the perfect qualities to serve
          as a password.

          There are steps that involve the user taking an action in order to

          vulnerabilities to errors (both slips and mistakes) and can add a
          certain level of complexity. A common structure was established to
          minimize the problems.

          This project never came out of development due to an early stop as
          state government intervention made vaccinations free for all eligible
          citizens. It was an incredible learning experience designing under the
          sprint-like time constraints for a cause important to me. Freedose may
          never have seen the day of light, but learnings from it will live in
          all the experiences I design onwards. 💜
